## Datasets
* The original datasets are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset).
* The processed datasets are available in [data folder](https://github.com/geonlee0325/covid_segmentation/tree/main/data).
 
## Running Demo
* For LLD and NLLD models, you can set the latent value (k) at line 21 in [nlds.py](https://github.com/geonlee0325/covid_segmentation/blob/main/code/nlds.py).
* You can run by excuting:
```setup
./run.sh
```
* There are 10 different *runtype*s:
